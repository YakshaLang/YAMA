# YAMA 0006 - C 2 C Compiler - Intermediate C99 to C99 optimizing compiler

- Author(s): Bhathiya Perera

<!-- different languages for code blocks are used to get maximum syntax matching for free, please ignore -->

## Problem

Yaksha uses `C` as a final compilation target. This is to introduce a way to have an intermediate `C` as a `IR` that can then be compiled to `C`

## Naming

* iC99 - Intermediate C 99

## Language

* Looks like C99.
* Loops -> for, while, dp while
* structs, constants, unions, #define
* We have built-ins such as `yk__sdsnew`, etc.

```
#define yy__raylib_Music Music

i32 yy__main() {
  yy__raylib_Music x;
  
  return 0;
}
```

## Architecture

* Tokenize
  * Level 1 -> no keyword recognition
  * Recognizes normal operators, identifiers, #?? and comments
  * Discard comments
* Parse all with pre processor statements
* Remove comments
* Apply #defines -> until there are no changes present
* AST based
* Only works with 1 file
* Entry points `yy__main` `yy__game_step`, `yy__init_state`

## Optimizations 

### Opt 01 - apply all #defines starting with `yy__`

* Implement a simple pre processor, however only capable of applying #defines that start with `yy__`
* Opt 01.01 - Support non function like macros
* Opt 01.02 - Support for function like macros

### Opt 02 - data types

* Opt 02.01 - Push down support of integer data types from Yaksha compiler to iC99.
* Instead of having extra complexity at the compiler level for i32, etc like data types, we push it to iC99.

### Opt 03 - clean up

* Opt 03.01 - Remove any method that cannot be reached from `yy__main()`
* Opt 03.02 - Remove any operation in same block after `return`

### Opt 04 - constant folding

* Opt 04.01 - Apply `-`
* Opt 04.02 - Remove excess `(` `)` parentheses 
* Opt 04.03 - Do basic math
* Opt 04.04 - Apply basic string built-ins
* Opt 04.05 - Apply basic array built-ins
* Opt 04.06 - Dead code elimination

### Opt 05 - apply constant function calls

* Everything is a constant expression?
* For each function things with simple math, assignments and built ins are considered pure
* Any of these pure functions can be invoked during compile time and folded

### Opt 06 - small function in-lining
* Inline small functions < 20 lines?

### Opt 07 - multiple rounds of previous optimizations 

while changed:
  * Opt 03
  * Opt 04
  * Opt 05
  * Opt 06
